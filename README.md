## Project Intro

## Setup

You'll need to make sure you have Node.JS installed. You can do this by entering `node --v` in your OS cli. If it returns a version number, then your good if not go to [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and download their runtime.

Also check for NPM (Node Package Manager) by running this command `npm --v`, if it does not work - please double check if Node is installed. Node usually installs NPM.

You will either need to install Git or GitHub Cli, depending on what you choose you can use the following commands to download our project:

**For Git**

```
    git clone https://github.com/TornadoWise/TornadoWise.git
```

**For GitHub CLI**

```
    gh repo clone TornadoWise/TornadoWise
```

### Step 1:

Now that you have downloaded the project, you will need to go into the project directory.

```
    cd /tornadowise
```

### Step 2:

Now install all the required dependencies so the project can run.

```
    npm install
```

### Step 3:

Now that all the dependencies are install, let's run the server.

```
    node index.js
```

In the terminal, you should see "Listening on port 8080."
